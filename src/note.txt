1) Creat a 'component' folder inside it-'Header.js' , import 'React' .
    Copy paste the navbar code from BootStrap React and import the required folders in Header.js

2) In App.js, Import the Header.js 
    call the Header tag in its body section <Header/>

3) Create new file Footer.js and import it to App.js
4) Create file -Reastaurant.js
    to store data in it we have declare state just after function line, 
    - import useState hook .... to declare and use state we need hook - useState

5) Creating API call (in js)
    ---------------
                                    AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and Xml
                                    We use the below 3 methods in AJAX for API call
                                        *XMLhttp
                                        *fetch
                                        *async & await
     the API call is done inside the restauratndata function with async() and await
     - await is used just before , along with the code containing the Asynchronous code

4) importing 2nd Hook  - useEffect     Hook      - similar to ngOninit block in angular
    a block is created with this hook

5)  Create new component -Restcard.js
    now we will send the data from Restaurantlist to Restcard
    In 'Restaurantlist.js', inside the <Restcard> Selector, we declare some variable 'data' and the item value is passed in it
    -Now the values in item can be accessed in Restcard.js, by calling {data} in function name- function Restcard({data}) { }

6) Card component coode is used in Restcard.js (from Bootstrap react)


 
    Redirection in React
    ====================

    Package - React-Router-Dom
        ---------------      >> npm i react-router-dom

    for Routing we need import the below components in  ---- App.js

    import {
        BrowserRouter as Router       - all components that need routing , they has to be added to BrowserRouter, and we need to set path for it
        Routes,                       - to set paths for each components
        Route                         - morethan one path
    } from 'react-router-dom';


7) New file - Viewrest.js

*>    useParams           - HOOK used for routing, just like ActivatedRoute
     ===========



Step)  - INside viewrest.js , import useParams hook
            import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom'

            this hook is to be stored in some variable inside the function - const params = useParams()

    - copy the api call code fully from Restaurantlist.js and paste it Viewrest
      now the enitre restaurants.json data can be accessed in Viewrest.js file


Step )  -   Create 2 new components - Reviews.js and Operatingtime. js
            to display the operating time and customer reviews inside button

REDUX
========
-State management Tool

help to pass states and props from one component to another, irrespective of their position in the component tree 

- Coupling - many connection between parent and child component

- Props drilling - in coupling, if any intermediate component have any errors all other childs will not work
    (used for passing data through several nested children components)
    (They are simply used as mediums for transporting this data to its destination component)
    (“drilling” comes in, where these components are forced to take in unrelated data and pass it to the next component,
     which in turn passes it, and so on, until it reaches its destination)

To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent

for this react introduced a new technology - state managemet technology -REDUX



REDUX Process
===============
Create new js file to keep the states, all the components can accesss the js file

- the componenrs can access the datas from the js file but they can't update data in js file

- Action - a file with all the logics to update the state
- Dispatch - - method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation
- Reducer - update the datas in js file according to the play load response  get form action file 


libraries

1 - Redux 
2 - React-Redux
3 - Redux-thunk

Installing redux and required libraries 
            >> npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk


Step) Create a js file in src (store.js)

        - createStore() - method used in REDUX to create store in js file
         ---------------
                        - it uses 2 argument:
                            1. reducer
                            2. middleware  (here middleware is used for making synchronous REDUX into asynchronous)
                                **  applyMiddleware() - method in REDUX to apply middleware 
                                   ```````````````````
                                ** combineReducers() - we may have 2 or more reducers in our application, we will need to combine them together
                                   ``````````````````
                                ** thunk - in REDUX- used to create middleware
                                  ```````

Step) Apply store in js file (index.js)
        - provider - its a tag used to pass the store (the tag is in 'react-redux')
         ----------

         in resturantlist.js we have defined state for allrestaurant and setallrestaurant
         the API call is created using async & await
         now we need to creat Action file in src and a new folder for actions.

AXIONS          - module used to make http methods ( for API calls)
=======

        >>   npm i axios

    now import Axiox in action file (RestaurantAction.js)


*>    useDispatch           - HOOK used to dispatch actions in components ( hook available in React-redux)
     ===========
